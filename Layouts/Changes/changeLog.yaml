    headline: England deaths within 28 days of a positive test for 0–4 year olds corrected
    body: > 
      Until 1 February 2021, the numbers of deaths within 28 days of a positive test
      in the 0–4 age group in England were showing as higher than they
      actually were because of a data error. This was corrected on 3 February 2021. 
    details: |
      On 2 February 2021 the breakdown of deaths by age for England was not included 
      on the website. 
      
      This issue only affected this single age group, the total number of 
      deaths is unaffected.
